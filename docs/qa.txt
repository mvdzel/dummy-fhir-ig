WARNING: ImplementationGuide/fhir.us.va.maps: ImplementationGuide.dependsOn[2]: The ImplementationGuide is based on FHIR version 4.0.1 but package openehr.base#0.1.0 is based on FHIR version 5.0.0. In general, this version mismatch should be avoided - some tools will try to make this work with variable degrees of success, but others will not even try
WARNING: ImplementationGuide/fhir.us.va.maps: ImplementationGuide.dependsOn[3]: The ImplementationGuide uses package hl7.fhir.us.core#5.0.1 released on 2022-06-22, but the most recent version is 8.0.0-ballot. This reference is getting old and the more recent version should be considered
